# Runway Analysis

The runway analysis estimates based on a takeoff or landing
performance and influences, such as wind, the ground roll and distance
to clear a 50ft obstacle. In addition, the analysis includes the remaining
margin of the runway.

## Takeoff & Landing Performance

To configure the takeoff or landing performance, follow the next
steps:

1. Configure the distances for a specific temperature and elevation.
2. Add a list of factors that influence the ground roll as described
   in the POH. Those factors can be configured as rated factor or
   factor for a value range.

## Altering Factors

The following factors can be add to the performance configuration:

- Decrease for headwind
- Increase for tailwind
- Increase for combination of RWYCC and surface
- In- or decrease for runway slope
- In- or decrease for weight if e.g. the base configuration is for
  Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW)

## Additional factors in Flight Planning

Besides the influencing factors described in the POH, further factors
can be defined in the flight planning. Those factors can implement
national recommendations like the _Flugsicherheitsmitteilung (FSM)
3/75_ in Germany. Those factors are add to the aircraft's influenced
ground roll and distance to clear a 50ft obstacle in the order of
configuration.
