//! Measurement of physical quantities.
//!
//! A [`Measurement`] represents a physical quantity with a value measured in
//! some unit. Each measurement is provided with a unit that is part of the
//! International System of Units (SI) unit system to allow operations between
//! measurements.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Basic example to add two lengths and get the speed by dividing the distance
//! by time:
//!
//! ```
//! # use efb::measurements::*;
//! #
//! // we have a distance a of 10 nautical miles
//! let a = Length::nm(10.0);
//! // and want to add b which is 40 kilometer
//! let b = Length::m(40000.0);
//!
//! let dist = a + b;
//! // 40 km equals 21.6 NM
//! assert_eq!(dist.value().round(), Length::nm(31.6).value().round());
//!
//! // lets say we need for this distance 15 minutes
//! let speed = dist / Duration::s(60 * 15);
//! assert_eq!(speed.value().round(), Speed::kt(126.0).value().round());
//! ```
