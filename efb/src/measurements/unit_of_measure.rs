/// A trait that implements a unit of measure.
///
/// The unit of measure of some value converts to and from the International
/// System of Units (SI) and to other units of the same measured entity. The
/// unit of measure can then be used to define a [`Measurement`].
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Basic usage implementing a length measurement:
///
/// ```
/// # use efb::measurements::{UnitOfMeasure};
/// enum LengthUnit {
///     Meters,
/// }
///
/// // the length's value is a float
/// impl UnitOfMeasure<f32> for LengthUnit {
///     fn symbol(&self) -> &'static str {
///         match self {
///             Self::Meters => "m",
///         }
///     }
///
///     fn from_si(value: f32, to: &Self) -> f32 {
///         match to {
///             Self::Meters => value,
///         }
///     }
///
///     fn to_si(&self, value: &f32) -> f32 {
///         match self {
///             Self::Meters => *value,
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
/// [`Measurement`]: super::Measurement
pub trait UnitOfMeasure<T> {
    /// The unit's symbol e.g. `m` for meters.
    fn symbol(&self) -> &str;

    /// Converts the value which is in the SI unit to another unit.
    fn from_si(value: T, to: &Self) -> T;

    /// Converts to the value in the SI unit.
    fn to_si(&self, value: &T) -> T;

    /// Converts the value from any unit to another.
    fn convert_to(&self, value: &T, other: &Self) -> T {
        Self::from_si(self.to_si(value), other)
    }
